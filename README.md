> Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion/flow models have drawn considerable attention recently due to their remarkable ability to deliver flexible visual creations. Still, high-resolution image synthesis presents formidable challenges due to the scarcity and complexity of high-resolution content. To this end,  we present **HiFlow**, a training-free and model-agnostic framework to unlock the resolution potential of pre-trained flow models. Specifically, HiFlow establishes a virtual reference flow within the high-resolution space that effectively captures the characteristics of low-resolution flow information, offering guidance for high-resolution generation through three key aspects: initialization alignment for low-frequency consistency, direction alignment for structure preservation, and acceleration alignment for detail fidelity. By leveraging this flow-aligned guidance, HiFlow substantially elevates the quality of high-resolution image synthesis of T2I models and demonstrates versatility across their personalized variants. Extensive experiments validate HiFlow's superiority in achieving superior high-resolution image quality over current state-of-the-art methods.

HiFlow constructs reference flow from low-resolution sampling trajectory to offer initiation alignment, direction alignment, and acceleration alignment, enabling flow-aligned high-resolution image generation. Specifically, HiFlow involves a cascade generation paradigm: First, a virtual reference flow is constructed in the high-resolution space based on the step-wise estimated clean samples of the low-resolution sampling flow. Then, during high-resolution synthesizing, the reference flow offers guidance from sampling initialization, denoising direction, and moving acceleration, aiding in achieving consistent low-frequency patterns, preserving structural features, and maintaining high-fidelity details. Such flow-aligned guidance from the sampling trajectory facilitates better merging of the structure synthesized at the low-resolution scale and the details synthesized at the high-resolution scale, enabling superior generation.
